INGREDIENTS:
1. Coconut oil (to grease pan)
2. 1 ¾ cups brown rice flour
3. ¼ cup coconut flour (helps absorb excess moisture and adds to texture)
3. 1 tsp baking soda in a little water (helps loaf rise)
4. ½ tsp sea alt
5. ½ cup solid butter
6. ½ cup maple syrup, plus topping
7. 2 lightly beaten eggs
8. 1 tbsp honey
9. 4 frozen bananas, thawed and mashed
10. Optional: 1 tbsp vanilla extract
11. Optional: chopped walnuts
12. Optional: cinnamon to taste

DIRECTIONS:
1.	Preheat oven 350 degrees
2.	Soften butter on the counter
3.	Thaw bananas for 10 minutes on the counter
4.	Grease baking pan with coconut oil
5.	Sift flour into large mixing bowl
6.	Add dry ingredients (sea salt, optional cinnamon)
7.	In a separate large bowl, cream the butter with a hand blender
8.	Cream maple syrup into butter (should have smooth consistency)
9.	In a separate bowl, beat eggs thoroughly with a fork
10.	Cream eggs into maple syrup/butter mixture with hand blender
11.	Cream honey into moist mixture with hand blender
12.	In a separate bowl, mash thawed bananas
13.	Using a wooden spoon, blend mashed bananas into wet ingredients
14.	Add a little water to the baking soda and gently mix
15.	Add baking soda, optional vanilla extract and walnuts to wet ingredients and mix thoroughly with wooden spoon
16.	Add moist mixture to dry ingredients in batches, mixing only until there are no more dry parts and the flour is just moistened (don't over mix the batter or it can get too tough)
17.	Optional: Once everything is combined, let ingredients sit to intermingle
18.	Pour batter into greased baking pan
19.	Draw a line down the middle of the loaf and fill it with maple syrup
20.	6. Bake at 350 until top is brown (around 60-75 minutes in electric oven, 45 in a gas oven)
21.	Optional: use a toothpick to test if it's baked enough on the inside
22.	Allow to cool 1 hour
23.	To remove from baking pan: Don't flip onto a rack! Otherwise you risk the loaf crumbling into pieces. Instead, gently roll it out onto a smooth, flat surface like a large cutting board. Flip it gently and let it continue to cool on a heat-protected surface.
24.	Slice with a serrated bread knife and enjoy :-)
